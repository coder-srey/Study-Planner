Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor by Microsoft, and we used it to edit the various Page and scripts as well as HTML/CSS.<br/>

 ## Steps to install
1. Download the VS Code Installer for Windows.
2. Run the Installer, and you can observe that Installer is Installed in
    C:\Users\ {Username}\AppData\ Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code
3. VS Code has both User Level and System Level setups available.<br/>
User Level setup is smoother than System Level. As well, System Level Requires Administrator Privileges.
